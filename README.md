# RPG-Project(Dungeons of Ewig)
 
A small ARPG project named Dungeons of Ewig inspired by Minecraft Dungeons, Inquisitor: Martyr and other popular action-roleplaying games.

The game was mad in Unity 5. With assets made by me and some aquired from the Unity Asset Store.

# The Story

You are an intruder in a cursed dungeon where tormented souls came back to life. You need to survive.

# The Gameplay

You need to find the enemy spawner(Tombstone) and interact with it so that enemies stop spawning and overrun you. Every spawner heals the player on destruction.
Items can be picked up and equiped so that you can fight multiple enemies at once and survive.
Health potions are scattered around the level, can be interacted with to heal the player for 25 points.
